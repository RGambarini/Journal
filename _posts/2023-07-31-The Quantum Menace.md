## The TRUTH Science Youtubers don't want you to know! REVEALED

If you're like me, You're interested in new technologies and science topics like [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), and [Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology). You are subscribed to a couple of science youtube channels, and follow a popular scientist's twitter account. But much like it has done with social interaction and privacy, the internet tends to ruin everything. Too many articles are titled with outrageous headlines such as "[Is Gravity a Hoax? New Research Will Shock You!](https://medium.com/carre4/gravity-does-not-exist-and-the-big-bang-was-not-the-creation-of-our-universe-1d4f1e08489f)", "[Scientists Discover Parallel Universes - Prepare to Have Your Mind Blown!](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/11/03/alternate-universes-discovered/75102502/)", "[Einstein Was Wrong! New Physics Theory Shakes the Foundations of Science!](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwinhNP9ksr9AhUFUcAKHXjDBt0QFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scientificamerican.com%2Farticle%2Fwas-einstein-wrong-about-relativity%2F&usg=AOvVaw1Ejl7lip0N2xLs_PRsHKy8)". Mind you, I've linked to articles that don't stoop down this low, but you've seen these before.

I try to put myself in the shoes of these authors and publications. We have a very limited time to enjoy the almost endless resource of knowledge and entertainment that the internet provides. Companies have to work hard to get users' attention in the crowded online space. This gives rise to what is popularly called 'clickbait' articles. Providing the possible customer a window of excitement that borderlines on lies.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There are worrying ramifications of this phenomena. How much are you allowed to 'embellish' the truth in order to captivate your audience? This is not that significant when it is about the dating life of some celebrity that will disappear from the public eye in 5 years, but this is different. Einstein is a bit late to defend himself with an open letter in the New York Times, but the concern rises when people are tired of hearing the same story. Outlandish headlines are confused with incredible facts and the trust that people have in science will be irreparably damaged. More than ever before the phrase 'trust science' has been uttered to deaf ears. Although scientists should be encouraged to attempt to break science in favour of new discoveries and a better understanding of nature, people depend on scientists to uphold their 'science' to a digestible and factual standard.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There is probably no science that suffers more from this effect than quantum mechanics. First of all, yeah, its pretty weird. There's a very good chance that you don't understand quantum mechanics because I truly believe that no one actually understands it. Yes. Mathematical tools help us understand quantum properties, but we still don't fully understand why they work.

This field is open to creativity and discovery, but also prone to 'bad science'. [Deepak Chopra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra) is an Indian-American alternative medicine advocate, who has written extensively about how quantum mechanics intersects with spirituality, health, and wellbeing. Some of his interpretations of quantum mechanics have been [controversial](https://dailyorange.com/2020/10/35-su-physics-students-faculty-denounce-deepak-chopra-event/?utm_content=cmp-true) and are [criticized](https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2014/07/deepak-chopra-doesnt-understand-quantum-physics-so-brian-cox-wants-1000000-him) by scientists and skeptics, who argue that there is no experimental basis to his claims. He is, more than anything, an opportunist. One, among a list of others, who saw complexity and ignorance as an opportunity to provide his own 'opinion' on the subject.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Although I am not one to dismiss theories as far fetched as they seem. I insist that theories must be subjected to rigorous proofs and debate. Otherwise, we might as well start calling Santa Claus a theory.

My intention is not to show you what quantum mechanics *is*. <d-footnote> My personal recommendation in the topic is the book by Leonard Susskind Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum</d-footnote> As there are enough books on the matter to fill several libraries. But instead show you what it is not. Some of these topics are spread around very much akin to gospel, where most of them are reliant on the faith the reader has for the author. So let's try to tackle a couple of the main flavors of quantum mechanics, dispel some long standing myths, and maybe you can also detect 'bad science'.

## Wave-particle duality EXPOSED

We will delve into five different phenomena of quantum mechanics, but it is only logical to start with a problem that preceded quantum theory itself. During the 17th century and until the days of [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) was the beginning and the end when it came to physics. Newton's most famous work, "[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophiæ_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica)", explained how objects move and how gravity works. <d-cite key="newton1934principia"></d-cite> This established Newton as the father of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics), which became the basis for understanding the physical world for centuries. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Although not as impactful as his previous work, Newton also published [Opticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticks), a book that analyzes the fundamental nature of light. Here, he proposed the "[corpuscular theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light)", which postulated that light was made up of tiny particles or "corpuscles" that traveled in straight lines and could be reflected and refracted <d-cite key="newton1952opticks"></d-cite>. At the time, going against the dogma of Newton was illogical. He was the Michael Jordan of the era if Mike also dominated Baseball and Golf. But [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)) accepted the challenge, as he was a bit of a maverick himself.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/17thCen.jpg"%}
 <div class="caption">
    <em>Thomas Young (left) and Sir Isaac Newton (right).</em>
</div>

[Young shone a beam of light through a small pinhole onto a screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment). He put a barrier with two small holes in front of the light, and it passed through onto another screen. Young observed that the light passing through the two slits interfered with each other, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the second screen. This pattern could only be explained if light behaved as a wave, similar to waves in a pool of water.<d-cite key="jaeger2009double"></d-cite> 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/doubleslit.jpg"%}
 <div class="caption">
    <em>Typical rendition of the double slit experiment</em>
</div>

It was only a century later that this problem would be discussed in the context of quantum mechanics, as scientists tried to understand the discoveries made by Einstein. He used Young's research and the current findings of [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck), regarding quantizing energy, to write the first of his *[annus mirabilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis)* papers. <d-footnote>It was in this year that Albert Einstein  published important discoveries concerning the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the special theory of relativity</d-footnote> In his Nobel Award-winning research of the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect) Einstein proposed that light was not only quantized, but that it also behaved as both a particle and a wave. <d-cite key="albert1905heuristic"></d-cite> Although Einstein accurately described the phenomena, the wording of the statement gives the wrong idea of what is *not* happening.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/20thCen.jpg"%}
 <div class="caption">
    <em>Max Planck (Left), Albert Einstein (Center), and Niels Bohr (Right)</em>
</div>

The idea of the [particle-wave duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality) gives a student the wrong impression about the fundamental nature of light. It is not a particle and a wave in the same way an apple is round and red. These descriptions are not fundamental in the identity of light. Neither a particle nor a wave, light is [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon). These are [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) that make up what we eventually see as light. Whether these photons behave as particles or as waves depends on how we measure them. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

On many papers regarding this topic, [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr) gave us the concept of [complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)) to describe how some phenomena can be true when measured individually but never simultaneously. <d-cite key="qian2018bohr"></d-cite> What does this mean? Let me put it bluntly: there are no individual experiments where light behaves both as a particle *and* as a wave. We can make a measurement about the position of a photon and a measurement of its wavelength but never both.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> "*Light behaves as a particle OR as a wave*"

## Heisenberg uncertainty principle UNCOVERED

Bohr's complementarity tells us the first *weird* property from quantum theory. There are limitations regarding what you are allowed to measure at the quantum scale. If we take this as a fact, there is only one reasonable question to ask afterwards: Why is this happening? [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg) was a student of Bohr and worked closely with him at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/), Denmark. <d-footnote>Now the Niels Bohr institute</d-footnote>
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/heisenberg.png"%}
 <div class="caption">
    <em>Werner Heisenberg</em>
</div>

Heisenberg's own research built upon Bohr's ideas of complementarity and expanded upon them to develop the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. While his supervisor's work showed that particle and wave properties complement each other to fully define a photon's properties, Heisenberg wanted to establish this rule at a more fundamental level.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/alice.jpeg"%}

> “<em>Ever since her last science class, Alice had been deeply puzzled by something, and she hoped one of her new acquaintances might straighten out the confusion. Putting down her cup of tea, she asked in a timid voice, “Is light made of waves, or is it made of particles?” “Yes, exactly so,” replied the Mad Hatter. Somewhat irritated, Alice asked in a more forceful voice, “What kind of answer is that? I will repeat my question: Is light particles or is it waves?” “That’s right,” said the Mad Hatter.</em>”

Heisenberg's [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) states that the product of the uncertainty $$\Delta$$ from two complementary properties of a quantum system (such as position $$x$$ and momentum $$p$$) cannot be smaller than a certain minimum value, which is determined by the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) $$h$$. <d-cite key="hendry1984uncertainty"></d-cite> This means that the more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be measured, and vice versa.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

$$ \Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4 \pi} $$

This is not as outlandish as it superficially seems. Consider the act of taking a picture as an individual measurement, and the act of making a video as a separate individual measurement. At a drag race, I take a picture of the speeding cars while you take a video with your smartphone. My picture provides a perfect representation of the position of the car, but I have no idea of its speed. Alternatively, your video gives you an idea the speed from the time it took to reach its final position from the start of the recording. While your video gives you a good measurement of the speed, the position of the car is spread throughout the first and final frame.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Obviously this is not an apples to apples comparison. As a rule of thumb there are no good analogies in quantum theory. Analogies invariably ignore factors that are fundamental in the understanding of quantum theory. The uncertainty principle is simply not applicable at our scale. <d-cite key="home1995incompatibility"></d-cite> At the [macroscopic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale), the position and velocity can be measured with arbitrary precision, as the uncertainties are much smaller than the values of these properties. Macroscopic objects have much larger masses and velocities than the particles that obey quantum mechanics. While large objects still follow the uncertainty principle, their behavior is not affected by it.

You cannot determine the opposite in either scenario as the frequency is hard to determine when it slows down and the amplitude is spread when it gains speed.</em>

## Schrödinger's cat paradox HE'S ALIVE

I don't think I even need to explain the [Schrödinger's cat problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat). It has become the flag for quantum mechanics due to its simple paradoxical aspect. It's a great conversation starter for people that know nothing of the topic.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

 <div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgRViUJ3J4E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<div class="caption">
    <em>Watch at your own discretion</em>
</div>

For all the good that the Schrödinger's cat problem did in regards popularizing quantum mechanics, it had an equally negative effect on making the theory any more clear. In this problem a cat is put in a box that contains a deadly object that could or could not kill the cat. The popular interpretation is that this duality shows the nature of an object that is subject to quantum effects before any measurement is performed. <d-cite key="schrodinger1935present"></d-cite> In quantum physics this property is called [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition). A quantum particle is in superposition when it can be in two or more states at the same time, with each state representing a possible outcome of a measurement. A perfectly good analogy, but like I said before "there are no good analogies in quantum theory".
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/erwin.png"%}

<div class="caption">
    <em>Erwin Schrödinger</em>
</div>

[Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schrödinger) would probably be unmeasurably dismayed by the idea that his paradox would be described as anything other than 'ridiculous'. As a proponent of clear physical theories, Schrödinger was uncomfortable with his contemporaries interpretations that relied on probabilistic outcomes. He was opposed to what is currently known as the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation). He insisted that the properties from a particle should not be in 'flux' before being measured, so he proposed a thought experiment of a cat in a box to show the 'absurdity' of the claim. This paradox is what could be called a *reductio ad absurdum* of the Copenhagen interpretation. Or in plain english, to 'reduce until absurdity'.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Today, we are still not quite sure what to make of objects in superposition. But time after time, experimental evidence shows that Schrödinger's dream of a clear physical theory for quantum mechanics is less likely.<d-cite key="aspectpioneering"></d-cite> The Copenhagen interpretation is currently the most likely explanation.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

So next time someone tries to explain superposition with the Schrödinger's cat problem, call animal protection services. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## The observer effect CONSPIRACY

The Copenhagen interpretation tells us that interacting with objects at a quantum scale breaks the superposition of the object and gives us a a result that depends on the probability distribution. Right now you might be thinking you found a glaring error in quantum mechanics. "*This uncertainty only occurs since you have to interact with incredibly small objects. Measurements that do not disturb objects at the quantum scale would remove all uncertainty*". While the interaction between the observer and the observation does disrupt these minuscule objects, this relates to a different phenomena in quantum mechanics.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

'Shine a laser towards a stationary car and the time it takes for the laser to come back' is a measurement we can make to get how far you are from the car. Shinning a laser towards a quantum particle will have the same effect, but it will no longer be where it was. Even if the particle was stationary, the high energy beam will blast the particle away from where it currently sits. Any measurement leads to an irreversible interaction.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Is there a way to reduce how much our measurements interact with the observation? Microscopes work similarly to the how I measured the distance to a car with a laser. Instead of a high energy beam, the images formed by a microscope are produced by the reflection of light from the target. Our goal would be to shine a light with such a low energy that it would not have an effect on the particle, much like the laser has no effect on the car.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/spectrum.jpg"%}

<div class="caption">
    <em>The electromagnetic spectrum shows the different ranges of light</em> <d-cite key="spectrum"></d-cite>
</div>

This is where it stops being challenging and becomes impossible. Light in the form of radio waves would have very little effect on our target particle, but we wouldn't get a very good image from it. <d-footnote> Imagine having to use AM radio to watch TV </d-footnote> On the other hand, ultraviolet light would give us a great looking image but it would be strong enough to rip an electron right out of an atom. This was the problem formulated by Heisenberg when trying to measure the position and velocity of an electron. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Uncertainty is a fundamental property of quantum systems that limits our ability to measure certain properties with precision, while the [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)) is a consequence of the act of measurement itself that can change the system being observed. To notice the difference, go back to the double slit experiment. When a detector is placed to determine which slit a particle passes through, the wave pattern disappears, and light behaves like particles. However, when the detector is removed, the wave pattern returns.<d-cite key="kocsis2011observing"></d-cite> This indicates that uncertainty is not solely a consequence of the observer effect since the particles' behavior is influenced by their wave-like nature, not just the act of measurement.

## Entanglement UNTANGLED

If this has been confusing to you, I'm afraid that this last quantum weirdness is the weirdest of them all. Entanglement has been the subject of many advancements in science recently with successes in [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing), [quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography), and [quantum teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation). Unfortunately, the same has been seen with more outrageous claims such as [faster-than-light communication](https://www.livescience.com/27920-quantum-action-faster-than-light.html) and cloning. <d-cite key="yang2021experimental"></d-cite> Even the topics that are legitimate areas of research sound so silly. It's not a surprise that this is the one quantum phenomena that gets the most extravagant titles.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Let's get something straight first. As far as we know:

> *Nothing has ever travelled faster than light*

For reasons that should be better explained in a separate article, Einstein's theory of relativity tells us that nothing can travel faster than light. No experiment so far has contradicted this idea, and no scientist worth his degree has ever claimed otherwise. Claims of faster-than-light communication have been perpetuated by those that have only read headlines on the matter. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

These claims come from a phenomena that was presented by Einstein, and similar to Schrödinger's cat, it debated a paradoxical behavior in quantum mechanics. In the year 1935 Albert Einstein, along with collaborators Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, published a paper that discussed the implications of uncertainty on two particles. The authors introduce the concept of "entanglement" between particles, in which the state of one particle is intimately connected to the state of another particle, even if they are separated by a large distance. <d-cite key="einstein1935can"></d-cite>
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In all previous topics, we've focused on the quantum properties of a single object. On the case of entanglement, a system of two particles becomes linked and their properties are correlated. In an entangled system, measurements of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of the other particle, even if they are separated by large distances. In the typical scenario, Alice and Bob each have a half of an entangled pair. Alice boards a space ship and heads to Alpha Centauri with her entangled particle. By measuring her particle, she not only gets information about her own particle, but also Bob's particle. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/epr.jpg"%}
<div class="caption">
    <em>Albert Einstein (Left), Boris Podolsky (Middle), and Nathan Rosen (Right)</em>
</div>

Einstein attempted to solve this contradiction by comparing entangled particles to a pair of gloves. To him, a pair of entangled particles are created as opposites. This way, even when separated by galactic distances, they will be measured as if it was reacting to the counterpart. Unfortunately for him, multiple recent experiments have shown that entanglement is nothing like matching clothes. <d-cite key="aspectpioneering"></d-cite>
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/Quantum Menace/light.jpg"%}

Although it might seem like information is transmitted instantaneously, we have to remember an important fact. The creation of entangled particles must occur in the same location. Starting from this point all of the necessary exchange of information has occurred. The distance that Alice travels becomes irrelevant, since if she actually makes it to Alpha Centauri it would be limited by the speed of light as well. Strictly speaking, Alice is not measuring the state of her particle. She is measuring the state of the whole system. Additionally, measurement on Alice's particle will be random, and it cannot be predicted in advance. Thus, there is no way to use entanglement to transmit information from one particle to the other. As a final nail in the coffin, entanglement only lasts until measurement. This event causes the entangled particles to 'un-entangle' each other. No information can be exchanged. No rules are broken.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## It's actually not THAT hard

It's quite remarkable that our group of hairless apes have managed so much in so little time. In some way, I think we are not meant to completely understand quantum mechanics. It might seem like a very pessimistic view, but its just not that useful to a human being. In the Paleolithic era, where most humans were hunter-gatherers, it didn't really matter if you knew what a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) was. Can you kill big animal with pointy thing? You're an instant legend. In our macroscopic world we don't have to consider the probabilistic consequences of our actions. For the most part, our actions are perfectly predictable. Our brains have evolved to match these laws and is what allowed us to become the planet's apex predator. It is not that unrealistic that our understanding of a scale that's beyond simple observation is flawed. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

This is a theory that has no easy answers. There are no shortcuts available or 20 minute videos to explain the whole topic. No "Quantum Mechanics for Dummies" book is ever going to be short enough to encapsulate all the complexity in the field. But then again, it wouldn't be interesting if it was that easy. I would go even further to say that I would be quite dissapointed if we completely solved the field of physics.

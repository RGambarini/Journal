My name is Roberto Gambarini and I am a researcher and engineer with a background in **biology**, **chemistry**, and **physics**.

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1997 and earned my BSc in **biomedical engineering** with a minor in **chemistry** from the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/departments/biomedical_engineering/index.php) in 2020 (fun year). During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on point-of-care diagnostics for resource-limited settings using nanotechnology, as well as research on the manipulation of cell membrane environments to prevent fusion among immune cells using computer simulations.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued an MRes in **molecular engineering** from Imperial College London and graduated with distinction. The MRes was hosted by the [Institute of Molecular Science and Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/molecular-science-engineering/), one of Imperial College London's seven Global Challenge Institutes. During this program, I collaborated with the company [BASF](basf.com) to develop a computational tool for the prediction of enantiomeric solubility.

My research interests include **quantum mechanics**, **statistical mechanics**, and **fundamental physics**, and I am eager to continue exploring these topics and their potential applications in the field of molecular engineering and beyond.

*I also like long walks on the beach, cozy rainy days, and a good book*
